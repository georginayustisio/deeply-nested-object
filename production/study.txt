As the days grow shorter and the temperature drops, the arrival of winter in New York signals 
a noticeable change in the air we breathe and the general feel of the city. The once brisk autumn 
breeze now carries a biting chill, and the cityscape undergoes a magical metamorphosis. It’s a time 
when cozy scarves and warm mittens become essential, and the aroma of roasted chestnuts mingles with
the fragrance of freshly baked treats.

Cinnamon rolls have become a cherished tradition of mine, a delightful way to share my warmth and spread
holiday cheer during this festive season. To me, there’s something truly enchanting about the entire 
process — the soft dough, generously sprinkled with a mixture of cinnamon, sugar, and butter, rolled into
spirals of sweet anticipation. As they bake in the oven, the kitchen is enveloped in the irresistible aroma 
of cinnamon, a scent that brings back memories of cozy gatherings and joyful moments. It’s not just the ingredients
themselves that make them perfect for the holidays. It’s about coming together with loved ones, rolling out
the dough, sprinkling the cinnamon-sugar mixture, all while exchanging stories and laughter. Then, as we 
settle down to enjoy these warm, gooey delicacies while sipping off a cup of hot chocolate, it’s as if we’re 
sharing a piece of our hearts, spreading the love and warmth that define the holiday season. Cinnamon rolls 
have become a symbol of the warmth, togetherness, and delicious indulgence that makes this time of year truly special.


Cinnamon Rolls Recipe by Joshua Weissman

Dough: 
4 cups all-purpose flour
½ cup granulated sugar
¾ tsp fine sea salt
⅓ cup unsalted butter
1 cup lukewarm whole milk
2 ¼ tsp instant yeast
2 eggs
1 egg yolk

Filling:
1 cup brown sugar
2 ½ tbsp cinnamon
⅓ cup unsalted butter
Cream Cheese Glaze:
4 oz cream cheese
¾ cups powdered sugar
3 tbsp whole milk

Instructions: 

1. In a stand mixer bowl, combine all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, and fine sea salt.
2. Add the softened unsalted butter.
3. In a separate bowl, combine lukewarm whole milk and instant yeast.
4. Using the dough hook attachment set on medium-low speed, add the yeast mixture, whole eggs, and egg yolk. Mix for about 2-3 minutes.
5. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough for 30-60 seconds. Place the dough into a greased bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Let it rise in a warm place for 90 minutes.
6. Once the dough has risen, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon in a mixing bowl.
7. Roll out the dough onto a light-floured surface into a large rectangle.
8. Spread the entire rectangle with softened unsalted butter, then sprinkle the cinnamon mixture evenly over the dough.
9. Roll the dough tightly from the bottom to the top and slice it into 2” thick slices.
10. Grease a 9x13 baking dish, line the bottom with the rolls, and cover with plastic wrap. Let the rolls rise at room temperature for 30-45 minutes.
11. Bake in a preheated 375 F oven for 15-20 minutes. Allow the rolls to cool in the pan for 15 minutes before serving.
12. For the filling, beat together cream cheese and then blend in powdered sugar until smooth. Whisk in whole milk until smooth.
13. Drizzle the glaze over the cinnamon rolls and serve. 
14. Now, enjoy this heartwarming treat with your loved ones during this festive Christmas season. Pro tip: Pairing these freshly baked cinnamon rolls with a steaming mug of hot chocolate is the perfect match for a cozy and indulgent Christmas treat.
